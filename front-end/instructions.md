### Exercise: View cat breed attributes

```text
Given I am a user of a cat web application
I want to see a page with a table that contains multiple cat breeds
And I click on a specific entry on the data table 
Then I should be directed to a page of the chosen cat breed
And I should see the breed title, image, description, maximum weight, average lifespan
And I should see a map showing the origin of the cat breed
```

##### Technical Notes
- Integrate REST api endpoints to call for cat data
- Ensure these endpoints return mock data
- Use a free map service to show location
- Use jest and cypress to write unit and integration test.
