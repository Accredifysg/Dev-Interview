## Containerise an Application

1. Clone an open source project you would like to containerise. A couple of suggestions:

```
https://github.com/bregman-arie/node-hello-world
https://github.com/bregman-arie/flask-hello-world
```
2. Write a Dockerfile you'll use for building an image of the application (you can use any base image you would like)
3. Build an image using the Dockerfile you've just wrote
4. Verify the image exists
5. [Optional] Push the image you've just built to a registry
6. Run the application
7. Verify the app is running
