### Welcome

Hello! If you are reading this, then we are likely in the process of discussing with you for a technical role at [Accredify](https://www.accredify.io)

In order to advance you, we would like to know more about the way you solve problems.This repository contains a set of short, time boxed(1-3 hrs) coding exercises that you would use to demonstrate your skills and abilities

### Motivation

We know that there are mixed opinions about take-home test.Our motivation to use this method of assessment are due to the following factors.

 - üåé - We are a fully distributed team that has members working across multiple timezones. Async communication and work allows for collaboration.
 - üõ† - It matches our workflow. Our engineers would usually start on a self-directed exploration of a problem and then iterate between period of work,edits and reviews before making a pull request which would be approved by their peers. This take-home exercise mimics that workflow. 
 - ‚è≥ - It allows you to work at you own pace. We structure most of these exercises to take up a maximum of up to 3 hours. You are free to break this 3 hours into multiple session as you wish.
