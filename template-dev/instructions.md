### Overview

This exercise requires you to use the assets provided to design a certificate and a transcript.
The end product in PDF can be found in the _examples_ folder.

### Exercise 1: Design the certificate with the assets given

You are required to create a certificate using HTML, CSS and Javascript. You may refer to the sample certificate at [examples/Certificate.pdf] (boilerplate/examples/Certificate.pdf) to see how the final product should look like. The certificate should be A4-sized (210mm x 297mm), such that upon opening the HTML file on a browser and printing to PDF, the PDF output from the browser should be identical to the one provided.

The assets you will need to create the certificate can be found in the [assets] (boilerplate/assets) folder. You are required to find out the font size, font color and positioning of the items on the certificate yourself. You may choose to use any preferred method in order to make the positioning of texts and images as close to the provided sample as possible, such as converting the sample PDF into a background image.

You will also be required to retrieve data such as the recipient name and issued on date from the JSON file found in [json/sample_data.json] (boilerplate/json/sample_data.json) and display it on the certificate instead of hardcoding them.

The HTML file you create should be called "certificate.html".
Add your CSS codes in [css/app.css](boilerplate/css/app.css).
Add your JavaScript codes in [js/app.js](boilerplate/js/app.js).

### Exercise 2: Design the transcript with the assets given

You are required to create a transcript using HTML, CSS and Javascript. You may refer to the sample transcript at [examples/Transcript.pdf] (boilerplate/examples/Transcript.pdf) to see how the final product should look like. The transcript should be A4-sized (210mm x 297mm), such that upon opening the HTML file on a browser and printing to PDF, the PDF output from the browser should be identical to the one provided.

The assets you will need to create the transcript can be found in the [assets] (boilerplate/assets) folder. You are required to find out the font size, font color and positioning of the items on the transcript yourself. You may choose to use any preferred method in order to make the positioning of texts and images as close to the provided sample as possible, such as converting the sample PDF into a background image.

You will also be required to retrieve data such as the recipient name and the modules from the JSON file found in [json/sample_data.json] (boilerplate/json/sample_data.json) and display it on the transcript instead of hardcoding them. You are required to find out which of the data should be retrieved from the JSON yourself.

The HTML file you create should be called "transcript.html".
Add your CSS codes in [css/app.css](boilerplate/css/app.css).
Add your JavaScript codes in [js/app.js](boilerplate/js/app.js).
