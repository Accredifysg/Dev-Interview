## Definition of Done

>The **definition of done** is exactly what you think: a list of criteria that has to be met before any work can be considered **done**. _Failure to meet any one of these conditions means the work is not complete_.

### Why?
At **Accredify**, we consider the _definition of done_ to be one of the most important parts of a project if not **_the_ most important**

Having this means that everyone  **knows what to aim for** in terms of code quality which facilitates the integration with the rest of our codebase.
